1)Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/version/3
Dataset is larger than 25 MB and couldn't be hosted on Github


2)LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR Code is refrenced from:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/55bf5d9/sklearn/neighbors/lof.py#L19

Lists all functions that can be used as well as some coding examples, 
which I studied to implement in my project 

LOF examples: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_lof_outlier_detection.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neighbors-plot-lof-outlier-detection-py

3)ISOLATION FOREST is referenced from:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/55bf5d9/sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py#L27
